As the old saying goes, you have to learn how to walk before
you can run. Likewise, you have to learn the basics of Java
before you can build complex programs....


------------------------------------------------------------>



Order of initializtion: 
	
	1. Instance fields or instance blocks (initialized in order they go in the file) 
	2. Constructor
	
public class Chicken {
	int eggs = 10;
	{System.out.println(eggs)}
	{eggs = 12}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Chicken obj = new Chicken(); 
		System.out.println(obj.eggs);
	}
}

// OUTPUT: 12 

	<!> We cannot print a field before its initialization: 	
		
public class Chicken {
	{System.out.println(eggs)} // DOES NOT COMPILE 
	int eggs = 12; 
}


Primitive datatypes: 
	
	char ---> -128 to 127 
	why? Because 0 is also positive.  

	very important: 
	
		'short' is 	16-bit data type
		'char' is also 	16-bit data type 
		
		HOWEVER: the char is unsigned. It means it does not include negative values, so it has more memory for positive values. 
		         In other words char can handle more positive values.
