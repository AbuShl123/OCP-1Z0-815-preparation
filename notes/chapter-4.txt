	switch() {}
		
		- suports enums, primitive numerics and strings
		- does not support float, double, long and boolean types and their corresponding wrapper classes
		- if a var resolves to one of the supported types then this var can also be used in switch statement
		
			* in Java 12 switch expressions were added  
		
	
	cases: 
		
		for cases we can use only literals, enums and final variables: 
			
			final int = 5;
			
		It is also strictly required that the value for final constants is initialized with the line of declaration 
		
	
	
	---> ! switch case support numeric promotion that does not require an explicit cast.
