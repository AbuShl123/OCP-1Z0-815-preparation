	String strip() methods: 
	
		- stripLeading() removes white spaces only in the beginning of the string
		- stripTrailing() removes white spaces only in the end of the string

important notes about string: 	
	
	"\t" - is a single character 
	"\t" and "\n" are also deleted with strip/trim methods

	StirngBuilder 

		- the delete() method of StringBuilder may accpet very large value as second parameter and still compile: 
	
			StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("apple");
			sb.delete(3, 100); // output: app
			// the code compiles even though 100 is beyond the string lenght

		- the replace() method is not the same as of String: 	
		
			StringBuilder replace(int startIndex, int endIndex, String newString); // <-- method signature

			first it deletes the chars from startIndex to endIndex inclusively and then inserts a newString
			basically, first delete() is calles then insert() 


====================================================================================================================

	
		interesting note to make: 

			'==' will throw compiler error if we try to compare two different objects
