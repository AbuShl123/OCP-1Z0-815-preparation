Working on mistakes:
	
	1 - B, E 	
		option F) is incorrect. 
		While java supports functional programming, it is still not considered to be a functional programming language
	
	2 - C, D 
		option F) is incorrect.
		option F) supposes that we input the .class file's full name along with its extenstion when running 'java' command. 
		I did not pay enough attention to option D
		
	12 - C, E 
		I missed option C) 
		When compiling with javac you can specify classpath -cp not only directory -d. So C) is also correct option. 
	
	13 - C
		everything is correct, just wanted to note that although javac can use both -d and -cp java can only lavarage -cp 
	
	14 - A, B, C, E 
		I missed option C)
		You can use classpath -cp with jar command 
		
	15 - E
		option D) is incorrect. 
		The main method here does not contain a static keyword!! Be more attentive!!
