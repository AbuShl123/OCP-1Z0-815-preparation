Working on mistakes: 
	
	5. A, D
	There was totally no reason to include E) and H) since the code does not compile. 
	The D) is also correct because float is being assigned to double. 

	9. I answered everything correct but interesting notes to do here: 
	
		- It is possible that the object is be eligible for garbage collection but never removed (For example because the program finished too quickly) 
		- The purpose of Garbage collector is to reclaim the used memory
			reclaim - вернуть, восстанавливать, исправлять 

	18. F, G
	Again - no reason to choose option A) since the code does not compile which means it will not print anything.
