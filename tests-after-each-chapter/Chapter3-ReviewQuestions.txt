Working on mistakes: 
	
	1. A, D, G
		We can actually cast boolean values, since boolean is a type. 
	
	5. A, C
		option F) says that ! is lower precdence than || and & which is not true

	6. F 
		option B) would be correct however on line 3 code does not compile. We cannot assign float value to long

	10. G
		everything is correct, just interesting note here: 
			int a = 10, b = 4; 
			short c = (byte) a + (byte) b; // DOES NOT COMPILE

	20. A, D, E
		option E) is so obvious, just did not notice
